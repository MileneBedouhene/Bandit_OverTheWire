# Bandit : Over The Wire 

- This repository also contains write-ups for the Bandit challenges from OverTheWire.
- These challenges are designed to teach the basics of Linux and cybersecurity by progressively solving levels with increasing difficulty.
- Each write-up will detail my approach, the commands used, and the lessons learned.
